# DDPG_MountainCar

A Tensorflow implementation of DDPG, and an investigation of various exploration methods.

Of particular note: parameter space noise, and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.

Hyperparameters are hard.

## Requirements:

- Numpy
- Tensorflow
- Open AI Gym

## How to run

Simply run one of the various ``mountain_exploration_method.py`` files.

If there is a model saved in the folder it will load and start the training/testing.
